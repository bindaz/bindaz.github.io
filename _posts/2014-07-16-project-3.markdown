description: This project involves the development of CyberDog, a bio-inspired quadruped robot. The project's scope includes the mechanical design, control systems, and simulation. The robot's structure is engineered for agility and dynamic movement, mimicking the locomotion of a real dog. The entire system is simulated and validated using Gazebo, a powerful robotics simulator, to test walking gaits, balance, and environmental interaction before physical implementation.
