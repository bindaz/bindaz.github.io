description: This project focuses on a continuous SLA 3D printing method. It utilizes an LCD screen paired with a 380nm wavelength LED array to cure the polymer. Unlike traditional methods that require a slow delamination process to separate the print from the FEP film, this technique employs a specialized liquid to minimize tension and vacuum forces. This innovation allows for a continuous printing process, achieving speeds up to two times faster than the Formlabs Form 2 machine.
